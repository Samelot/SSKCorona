Before Running
============
Before you run these samples, copy the folder 'ssk' into each sample.  

I could have done this for you, but this keeps the git small and helps me keep the whole repository neat.


Helper Scripts
============
I wrote two scripts to help copy SSK for you.  I've tested the Windows version, but not the OS X version, so use it with caution.
 * ssk_to_samples.bat (Windows) - Copies SSK into samples folder all at once.
 * ssk_to_samples.sh (OS X) - Copies SSK into samples folder all at once.
