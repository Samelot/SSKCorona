##### Latest News
--------------------------
As of 09 May 2013, the SSKCorona download has been reduced to the library ONLY.

I am temporarily taking the sampler, preset packs, resources, etc. offline as I prepare to put out a new Corona SDK tutorial series.

The content I am removing will mostly be replaced with free content, but maintaining two divergent sets of content is too difficult right now.

So, apologies in advance, but SSK Corona (the library) is still fully functional and free as promised previously.



##### Short and Sweet License 
--------------------------
1. You MAY use anything you find in SSKCorona to:
  * make applications for free or for profit ($).
  * make games for free or for profit ($).  
  
2. You MAY NOT:
  * sell or distribute SSKCorona or the sampler as your own work
  * sell or distribute SSKCorona as part of a book, starter kit, etc.

3. If you intend to use the art or external code assets/resources,  you must read and follow the licenses found in the various associated readMe.txt files near those assets.

4. It would be nice if everyone who uses SSK were to give me credit, but I understand that may not always be possible.  So, if you can please give a shout out like: "Made with SSKCorona, by Roaming Gamer, LLC.", super, if not, darn...  Also, if you want to link back to my site that would be awesome too:   http://www.roaminggamer.com/
