About SSKCorona
============
This code-kit has gone through numerous updates and re-orgs as I've tried to make it easily accessible to you, while still useful for me.  This kit came out of my need to do things faster and better than pure Corona SDK code would allow.  To that end, I have replaced, modified, extended, etc. many features of standard Corona SDK.  That is, in a nutshell, what SSK is.

If you are capable, inquistive, and brave enough, you can use and learn from SSK.  I believe you'll soon see the merits of using it and like me, never look back.

However, you must have a solid foundation in Lua programming and the Corona SDK APIs before you can truly understand and appreciate SSK.  So, if you're new or inexperienced, do yourself a favor and spend some time learning about Lua and Corona, then come back and give SSK a go.


SSKCorona Parts
============
As of 07 AUG 2015, SSK has been split as follows
 * Core - The SSK you will find here is the most reduced and CORE version.  i.e. The bits I find that I always need.  This reduced the footprint and simplified the library.
 * RG* Modules - All other parts that used to be in SSK and all future modules are now separated into stand-alone modules of the name RG*.  They will still work with SSK, but can also be used alone.

Where Is The Sampler?
============
I have tried over time to provide samples that folks can use and understand.  I did this via a unified sampler app.  

Unfortunately, I found, that no matter how hard I worked, folks couldn't understand how to extract the samples and use them.

So, I gave up ... sort of.  

Instead, there now a folder called 'samples/' containing simple standalone examples of SSK in action.  Go there and run them to see how easy and powerful SSK is to use.


Folders
============
 * com.roaminggamer.ssk/ - "Super Starter Kit" library.
 * docs/ - The "SSK Users Guide" and cheat sheets.  (Currently being updated as of '07 AUG 2015' )
 * samples/  - Individual samples that show how to use parts of SSK.  Note: Copy SSK into the folders before running samples.

Everything else is now distributed separately.
