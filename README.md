What Is Not Here (Yet)
============

This first version of the SSK sampler is a bit light as I work out some kinks with the videos.  However you can expect great things soon.  

This week should see the following additions:
- Videos (I'll move to Vimeo if the YouTube issues continue.)
- More Samples
- Transfer Frameworks (flat and Composer based).
- Android and iOS releases of the sampler.

Please be sure to check back regularly.  

Oh, and if you want to be on my testers list or be notified about releases, please e-mail me at: 

roaminggamer <at> gmail <dot> com

Put the word 'SSK' in the title at put this in the body (if it applies):
 * Want to be a tester 
 * Want to be notified about updates.

 Thanks!
