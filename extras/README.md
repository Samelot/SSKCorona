Extras
============
This is where I place a number of useful bits and pieces that I don't want to lose.

Many of these will be useful to you, some will not.  So, be aware before you start poking around in the code that it may misbehave.



What Is Here
============
 * art/ - Free art packs from various license holders.  See readme.txt and license.txt files in each sub-folder.
 * failedExperiments/ - Hey, no one gets it all right the first time.  These are a few of my expriments and failures.
 * presets/ - Several preset packs for the SSK Button library.
 * wip/ - Stuff I'm not ready to release yet, but want safely stored in the Git.
